# Spring Microservices

This repository contains two independent Spring Boot microservices, developed as part of **Chapter 8 â€“ Microservices with Spring** from the Java Advanced class:

- `order-service`: Manages customer orders
- `delivery-service`: Handles delivery processing

Both services are in the **same repository** to simulate a real-world, multi-service architecture while keeping the codebase centralized for easier collaboration and testing.

## Tech Stack

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4.5
- Maven
- JPA (Hibernate)
- Flyway (database migration)
- MySQL
- Eureka (Service Discovery)

## Purpose

Practice building and deploying decoupled microservices using Spring Boot, focusing on REST APIs, persistence, Flyway migrations, and service registration with Eureka.
